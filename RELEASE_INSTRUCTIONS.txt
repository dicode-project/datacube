How to release a new version to Sonatype (and thence automatically to Maven Central):

We don't use the maven release plugin because (I think) it's difficult or impossible to deploy
multiple artifacts like we do for Hadoop and HBase dependencies.

1. Be on master branch. Have the GPG secret key on your keyring. Have Sonatype credentials in your
 Maven settings.xml (per https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide).

2. Edit pom.xml to change x.y.z-SNAPSHOT to x.y.z and commit.

3. Tag with the current release version number

4. Build and deploy artifacts for each combination of Hadoop and HBase. At the shell:

 mvn -Prelease-sign-artifacts clean deploy   # To use the default versions

 for hbaseVersion in 0.92.1 0.90.5 0.94.0 ; do
   for hadoopVersion in 0.20.2 1.0.3 ; do
     mvn -DhadoopVersion=$hadoopVersion -DhbaseVersion=$hbaseVersion -Prelease-sign-artifacts clean deploy
   done
 done

 You can add -DskipTests=true if you dare, and you want to save some time on re-running tests.

5. Log in to the sonatype OSS site at https://oss.sonatype.org and:
  a. click "Staging repositories"
  b. find the repo containing the artifacts just uploaded
  c. check the artifacts in the repo to make sure there's no bogus crap in there
  d. hit the "close" button then the "release" button to promote that repo

6. Edit pom.xml to change x.y.z to x.y.z+1-SNAPSHOT and commit. Push the master branch back to 
 Github, which will send both this commit and the earlier commit (the one that removed -SNAPSHOT) 
 upstream.

7. Push the release tag to Github that you created: git push origin tag x.y.z

8. Wait up to two hours for the Sonatype repo to automatically sync with Maven Central.
